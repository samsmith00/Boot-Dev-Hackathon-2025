# 🕹️ Stickman Game – Boot.Dev Hackathon 2025

This is my attempt to make a fun little game (with pretty much zero game development experience) for the Boot.Dev 2025 Hackathon. Dodge boulders and lasers as a stickman in a simple but intense survival game.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use your keyboard (W A S D SPACE) to **move and dodge**.
- Avoid falling **boulders** and  **lasers**.
- Didn't have time for a difficulty progression so you get max difficulty right away 😁
- You have one objective => stay alive as long as possible!

## 📜 Notes

- Due to time constraints this game is NOT polished (and evidently so)
- The death screen, is unfinished and rushed, and I wanted the stickman's body to explode when he died but I was unable to deliver ☹️
- Simple physics, basic hitboxes, basic obsticals

## Ai Disclamer 🤖
- For some reason my usual pretty good math brain could not handle video game maths, used Ai to help get stickman's moving animations
- I have never compiled to multiple operating systems before, so I used Ai to help make the game Mac, Linux, and Windows compatable
