# 🕹️ Stickman Game – Boot.Dev Hackathon 2025

This is my attempt to make a fun little game (with pretty much zero game development experience) for the Boot.Dev 2025 Hackathon. Dodge boulders and lasers as a stickman in a simple but intense survival game.

## 📜 Notes

- This was a personal challenge to learn game dev from scratch.
- Simple physics, basic hitboxes, and hand-tuned gameplay.
- Expect jank, surprises, and maybe a laugh or two 😄

## Ai Disclamer 🤖
- For some reason my usual pretty good math brain could not handle video game maths, used Ai to help get stickman's moving animations
- I have never compiled to multiple operating systems before, so I used Ai to help make the game Mac, Linux, and Windows compatable
